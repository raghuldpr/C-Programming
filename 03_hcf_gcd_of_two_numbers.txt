PROGRAM 3: HCF (GCD) of Two Numbers

HCF (Highest Common Factor) / GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is the largest number that divides both a and b.
Uses the Euclidean Algorithm.

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a, b, temp;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    while(b != 0)
    {
        temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }

    printf("HCF = %d", a);

    return 0;
}

/*
Sample Input:
Enter two numbers: 12 18

Sample Output:
HCF = 6
*/
